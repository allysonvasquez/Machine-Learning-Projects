# Machine Learning Basics
This repository will act as my roadmap through machine learning. I will be teaching myself through exercises, notes, & code that I take while reading and watching various videos.

### Materials Used
* Book: [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/)
* Book: [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/)
* Youtube: [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5)

*Quick Note: I am not starting completely from scratch. I am in the middle of pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I am familiar and comfortable writing in Python, C++, and Java.*

#### Prior courses taken that pertain to ML:
  * Data Structures
  * Logic & Algorithms
  * Calculus
  * Linear Algebra
  * Intro to AI

To keep myself organized, I will break down what I learn into the following outline...
## Essential Libraries
While I am familiar with Python, I have little knowledge on the libraries needed to get into the meat of machine learning.
Libraries I will be learning (I will be adding information as I learn these topics):
* NumPy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Sci-kit Learn
* TensorFlow

## Notes (JupyterNotebook)
These notes will primarily follow the O'Reilly books mentioned earlier. 
(Links will be added as I go through the topics)

Rough outline of topics:
* Supervised Learning | Unsupervised Learning | Semi-supervised Learning | Reinforcement Learning
* Online Learning | Batch Learning
* Training Dataset | Testing Dataset
* Feature Extraction | Feature Selection
* Noise | Outliers | Garbage Data



## Exercises
Exercises will consist of small practice projects and various exercises I find online.
(Information will be added as I begin exercises)
