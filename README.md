# Machine Learning Basics
This repository will act as my roadmap through machine learning. I will be teaching myself through projects & notes that I take while reading notebooks and watching various videos.

### Materials Used
* Book: [Python for Data Analysis](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781491957653/)
* Book: [Introduction to Machine Learning with Python](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/introduction-to-machine/9781449369880/)
* Book: [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781491962282/)
* Youtube: [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5)
* Kaggle: [This site changed the game!](https://www.kaggle.com/allysonvasquez)

*Quick Note: I am not starting completely from scratch. I am in the middle of pursuing a BS in Computer Science. I am familiar and comfortable writing in Python, C++, and Java.*

#### Prior courses taken that pertain to ML:
  * Data Structures
  * Logic & Algorithms
  * Statistics
  * Linear Algebra
  * Calculus I-II
  * Artifical Intelligence

To keep myself organized, I will break down what I learn into the following outline...
## Essential Libraries
Notes on basic libraries needed for data analysis & visualization.
* [NumPy/SciPy](/Libraries/NumPy.ipynb)
* [Pandas](/Libraries/Pandas.ipynb)
* [Matplotlib](/Libraries/Matplotlib.ipynb) *Note to myself: add syntax on seaborn
* Sci-kit Learn
* PyTorch or TensorFlow

## Data Analysis
Projects related to accessing, reading, and editing data.

* [UNCC Data Analysis](/Projects/UNCC_data/uncc_dataset.py): Scraped UNCC student statistics into a pandas Series & visualized using matplotlib.

Future Projects:
* Kaggle stuff
* More Data Loading, cleaning, wrangling
* Plotting & Visualization
* Data Aggregation
* Time Series Data

## Machine Learning (the meat!)
Projects that use Machine Learning Algorithms to solve problems.
### Supervised Learning
* [Prediction Using Multiple Linear Regression](/Projects/prediction-w-multiple-linear-regression.ipynb): Very basic but very proud of my first machine learning project! This project/notebook trains a Linear Regression model to predict the BMI of a person given their gender, weight, and height.
### Unsupervised Learning
* Coming soon!
### Reinforcement Learning
* ..Coming sort of soon..
### Neural Networks
* ...Coming a little later....
